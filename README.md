# The Odin Project - Web Development 101

## Project - Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

I created a Rock Paper Scissors game using JavaScript. Check out the JavaScipt [here](https://crobbo.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/). 

# Summary 

* Wrote JavaScript functions
* Used Switch statements for the game logic over if statements due to readability. 
* Used a For Loop to repeat the game 5 times (later removed due to building front-end)
* Used JavaScript to manipulate the DOM.
* Built front end using HTML & CSS Grid. Styled useing CSS, JavaScript.

# Key Result

Solidified my knowledge of Switch statements & functions. It was my first project where I used JavaScript to manipulate HTML in the DOM.  

## Improvements
Could have spent some more time making it more aesthetically pleasing :)
