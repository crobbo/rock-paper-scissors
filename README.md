## Project - Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

I created a Rock Paper Scissors game using JavaScript. Check out the JavaScipt here, call the game() function to play!

# Summary 

* Wrote JavaScript functions
* Used Switch to keep my code clean
* Used a For Loop to repeat the game 5 times and then declare the winner.

# Key Result

Solidified my knowledge of Switch statements & functions.
